Q)Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operators, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

 

Test case 1:

Input: x = 4

Output: 2

Test case 2:

Input: x = 8

Output: 2

Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

 

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 231 - 1



Logic:

Here we are using a while loop until we get the desired square root 


Ans)
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
     long ans = 1;
     
        while (ans * ans <= x) {
            ++ans;
        }
        
        return (int) ans - 1;   
    }
}
