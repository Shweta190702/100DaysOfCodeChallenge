Question:
You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

CODE:   *\

class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int n = s.length();
        char c = t.charAt(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            c ^= s.charAt(i);
            c ^= t.charAt(i);
        }
        return c;
    }
}
