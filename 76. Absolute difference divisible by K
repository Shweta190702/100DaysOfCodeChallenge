Problem: Absolute difference divisible by K
Question: 
Given an array of integers of size n and an integer k, find all the pairs in the array whose absolute difference is divisible by k.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3 
arr[] = {3, 7, 11} 
k = 4 
Output: 3 
Explanation: (11-3) = 8 is divisible by 4 
(11-7) = 4 is divisible by 4 
(7-3) = 4 is divisible by 4

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countPairs() which takes integers n, array arr[ ], integer k as input parameters and returns the number of pairs whose absolute difference is divisible by k.
Note: The answer may be large so use 64-bit integer. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n + k)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(k)

Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ k,arr[i] ≤ 105

CODE:   */
class Solution {
	static long countPairs(int n, int[] arr, int k) {
		int[]mod = new int[k];
		for(int i : arr){
		    int rem = i % k;
		    mod[rem]++;
		}
		
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i : mod){
		    if(i!= 0)ans+= (i) * (i - 1) / 2;
		}
		return ans;
	}
}
