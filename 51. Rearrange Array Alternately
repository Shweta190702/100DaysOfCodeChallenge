/*
Given a sorted array of positive integers. Your task is to rearrange the array elements alternatively i.e first element should be max value, second should be min value, third should be second max, fourth should be second min and so on.
Note: Modify the original array itself. Do it without using any extra space. You do not have to return anything.
Example 1:
Input: n = 6 arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6} 
Output: 6 1 5 2 4 3 
Explanation: Max element = 6, min = 1, second max = 5, second min = 2, and so on... Modified array is : 6 1 5 2 4 3.

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function rearrange() which rearranges elements as explained above. Printing of the modified array will be handled by driver code.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^7

CODE:      */
