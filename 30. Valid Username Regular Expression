Problem Topic: VALID USERNAME REGULAR EXPRESSION(STRING)

PROBLEM: You are updating the username policy on your company's internal networking platform. According to the policy, a username is considered valid if all the following constraints are satisfied:
The username consists of 8 to 30  characters inclusive. If the username consists of less than 8 or 30 greater than  characters, then it is an invalid username.
The username can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). Alphanumeric characters describe the character set consisting of lowercase characters[a-z], uppercase characters[A-Z], and digits[0-9].
The first character of the username must be an alphabetic character, i.e., either a lowercase character or an uppercase character.

EXAMPLE:         Julia- Invalid(characters less than 8)
                 Shwetasuman- valid
                 Shweta_123- valid
                 1shwetasuman- invalid(starts with numeric which is not allowed)
                 Shweta@$suman- invalid(as @$ not allowed)
Update the value of regularExpression field in the UsernameValidator class so that the regular expression only matches with valid usernames.

Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer n, describing the total number of usernames. Each of the next n lines contains a string describing the username. The locked stub code reads the inputs and validates the username.

Constraints
1<=n<=100
The username consists of any printable characters.

Output Format
For each of the usernames, the locked stub code prints Valid if the username is valid; otherwise Invalid each on a new line.

ANSWER)
import java.util.Scanner;
class UsernameValidator {
    /*
     * Write regular expression here.
     */
    public static final String regularExpression = "^[A-Za-z]\\w{7,29}$";
}


public class Solution {
    private static final Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(scan.nextLine());
        while (n-- != 0) {
            String userName = scan.nextLine();

            if (userName.matches(UsernameValidator.regularExpression)) {
                System.out.println("Valid");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Invalid");
            }           
        }
    }
}
