Question)
Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.
Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

Example 1:
Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 105
ransomNote and magazine consist of lowercase English letters.

Logic:
We have first converted the string into character of arrays and then we have used the concept of ascii values to find the ascii value of a-z.
After that we have incremented the characters according to magazine string and decremented the ransomNote string.

ANSWER)
class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        int a[]=new int[26];
        for(char c:magazine.toCharArray()) //using enhanced for loop and traversing each and every elemnet in the char array.
        {
            a[c-'a']++;
        }
        for(char c: ransomNote.toCharArray())
        {
            if(a[c-'a']==0)
            {
                return false;
            }
            a[c-'a']--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
