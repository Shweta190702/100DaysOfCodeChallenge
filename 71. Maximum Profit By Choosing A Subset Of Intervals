Maximum Profit By Choosing A Subset Of Intervals

Question: 
Given a list intervals of n intervals, the ith element [s, e, p] denotes the starting point s, ending point e, and the profit p earned by choosing the ith interval. Find the maximum profit one can achieve by choosing a subset of non-overlapping intervals.
Two intervals [s1, e1, p1] and [s2, e2, p2] are said to be non-overlapping if [e1 <= s2] and [s1 < s2].

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
intervals = { {1, 2, 4}, {1, 5, 7}, {2, 4, 4} } 
Output: 8 
Explanation: One can choose intervals [1, 2, 4] and [2, 4, 4] for a profit of 8.

Example 2:
Input: n = 3 
intervals = { {1, 4, 4}, {2, 3, 7}, {2, 3, 4} } 
Output: 7 
Explanation: One can choose interval [2, 3, 7] for a profit of 7.

Your Task:
You don't need to print or output anything. Complete the function maximum_profit() which takes an integer n and a 2D integer array intervals and returns an integer, denoting the maximum profit which one can get by choosing the non-overlapping intervals.

Constraints:
1 <= n and n <= 104
1 <= starting point of ith interval < ending point of ith interval <= 105
1 <= profit earned by choosing ith interval <= 105

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        {
            dp[i + 1] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i + 1]);
            
            int low = 0, high = i;
            while(low < high-1) {
                int mid = low + (high - low)/ 2;
                if (jobs[mid][1] <= jobs[i][0]) {
                    low = mid;
                } else {
                    high = mid;
                }
            }
            dp[i + 1] = Math.max(dp[i + 1], ((jobs[low][1] <= jobs[i][0]) ? dp[low + 1] : 0) + jobs[i][2]);
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
