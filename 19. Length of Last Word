Q)
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Test CAse 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Test Case 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Test Case 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

Logic: We have used trim() method to eliminates leading and trailing spaces and lastIndexOf() method returns the last index of the given character value or substring.
If it is not found, it returns -1. The index counter starts from zero.
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.


ANS)
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        return s.length() - s.lastIndexOf(" ") - 1; 
    }
}
