Question:
Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example 1:
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Example 2:
Input: num = 0
Output: 0

Constraints:
0 <= num <= 231 - 1

Code:     */
public class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        return num - 9 * ((num-1)/9);
    }
}
